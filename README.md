## Demo and How to Play

![C#GameDemo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a26f5204-8d25-4075-9c78-d3ebc776bb89)


To start the game, double click on "Window.exe," in the C#Game folder from before. You can also compile and run it.
To play the game, you use the arrow keys and/or wasd. Left and right (a and d) apply a force that will gradually move your character right or left. Pressing down (s), will apply a force downward, which allows you to bounce higher. Get to the green exit and discover what happens!
